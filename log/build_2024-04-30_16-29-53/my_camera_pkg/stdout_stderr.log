[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findusb_cam.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "usb_cam", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "usb_cam" with any
  of the following names:

    usb_camConfig.cmake
    usb_cam-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "usb_cam" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "usb_cam_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "usb_cam" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
